\section{Objective}
The objective of this research proposal is to perform searches for
solutions to the apparent discrepancy between the Higgs mass and the
Planck scale (known as the ``hierarchy problem'' of the standard model
(SM)) that result in signatures containing highly Lorentz-boosted top
quarks. This research will be done at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{:2008zzk}. To
accomplish this objective, it is necessary to use new
techniques involving jet substructure and mass known generally as
``boosted jets'', or as ``boosted tops'' in the case of top quarks. 

In addition, this proposal outlines an innovative strategy for
educating young people and the general public, through public events
in ``Plain English'', as well as the development of a Mobile
Application that teaches particle physics to younger students in an
entertaining way. 


To accomplish these goals, Prof. Rappoccio's group consists
of Dr. James Dolen (postdoctoral fellow), Mr. Joshua Kaisen and Ms. Maral Alyari
(graduate students), Mr. Brendan Smith and Mr. Jonathan Goodrum (undergraduate
students, the latter supported under the ``Collegiate Science and
Technology Program'' (CSTEP)
at UB, which provides research funding for minority and
disadvantaged undergraduate students). Work has already started
on the proposed research using short-term startup funds. 




\section{Motivation}

With the discovery of a 
standard model (SM)-like Higgs boson at
125~\GeVcc\ during the 7 and 8 \TeV\ runs of the LHC 
(``Run 1'')~\cite{higgs_atlas,higgs_cms}, 
the focus of collider physics now turns to understanding the nature of
the observed mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking.
The SM is an effective theory, and quadratically-divergent
quantum-loop corrections to the Higgs
mass would require an enormous degree of fine tuning, if the Higgs
mass is to remain finite up to the Planck scale. This is commonly
referred to as the hierarchy problem, which can be resolved by
introducing contributions beyond the standard model (BSM). 
These BSM models must survive a myriad of precision tests of the SM
(such as the recent observation of $B_s\rightarrow
\mu^+\mu^-$~\cite{bsmumu_cms,bsmumu_lhcb}), and extensive direct
searches. 

Various mechanisms beyond the standard model
have been proposed to resolve the hierarchy problem.
Since the most divergent 
quantum correction to the Higgs mass
involves top quarks, it is natural to suppose
that these BSM mechanisms preferentially involve interactions with the
top quark to cancel this divergence.
Two major classes of models which solve the hierarchy problem
discussed above are supersymmetry
(SUSY)~\cite{Gunion:1987qv,Feng:1999mn,Kitano:2006gv,Barbieri:2009ev,Horton:2009ed}
and extra dimensions (ED)~\cite{ed,rs1,rs2,rs_gluon_1}. SUSY involves
a ``supersymmetry'' of nature, where all known particles have a
``superpartner'' of opposite spin (bosons have a fermionic partner,
and vice versa). The production of SUSY particles at the LHC typically
involves cascade decays resulting in top quarks and other light
supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric particles. ED postulates extra
spatial dimensions, in which gravity propagates differently than the
other forces, resulting in an apparent discrepancy in our local 3+1 dimensional
manifold (or ``brane''). ED models typically involve
Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of known particles, and KK gluons in
particular typically decay into $\ttbar$ pairs. 
One common feature of both of these models is the presence of top
quarks in the final state. 


To gain intuition into the kinematics of highly-Lorentz boosted top
quarks that decay into all-hadronic final states, consider
a highly-energetic particle
of mass $m$ which decays into two massless particles. The angular
distance between the two particles is given by 
$\Delta R \approx 2 / \gamma$, where $\gamma = E/m$ is the
Lorentz boost of the particle. 
For $\gamma > 3$, the angular separation
between the two decay products is less than 0.7, and thus, if
they decay hadronically,
the resulting decay products would be clustered into a 
single jet with traditional
jet-clustering techniques, which assume that the original partons
are separated by more than 0.7. Hence, traditional
techniques inadvertently remove events with $\gamma > 3$ from
consideration entirely. 

However, new jet-clustering techniques have been developed to handle
the cases for $\gamma > 3$, where the resulting jets from top-quark
decays overlap in the
detector~\cite{Seymour:1993mx,boostedhiggs,catop_theory,catop_cms,jetpruning1,jetpruning2,nsub,heptoptagger,trimming}.
Summaries of these techniques are in Refs.~\cite{boost2010,boost2011}.
These
large jets are referred to as 
``boosted jets'' (or ``boosted tops'' in the case of top quarks), and
they are
different from jets that originate from quantum chromodynamic (QCD)
processes in that they exhibit different internal structure
(``substructure''), and have an intrinsic jet mass. 
These algorithms
analyze the substructure and mass
of the boosted jet to break it up into smaller ``subjets'' which can be
analyzed at angular scales smaller than 0.7, thereby allowing analysis
of states with $\gamma > 3$. Figure~\ref{boostedtop_eventdisplay}
shows an event display of such a highly-boosted top quark at CMS. 
The blue rectangles represent the
energy measured in the hadronic calorimeter, the green
rectangles represent the energy measured in the electromagnetic
calorimeter, and the three groups of colored lines (purple, red,
and orange) represent three different subjets as measured in
the tracker. Using traditional reconstruction techniques, this object
would be reconstructed as a single four-vector, whereas the newer
techniques involving jet substructure are able to discern the three
separate subjets. 


\begin{figure}[h!]

      highly-boosted top jet. The blue rectangles represent the
      energy measured in the hadronic calorimeter, the green
      rectangles represent the energy measured in the electromagnetic
      calorimeter, and the three groups of colored lines (purple, red,
      and orange) represent three different ``subjets'' as measured in
      the tracker.}
\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{limits-kk_combined}
    \caption{\label{fig:limits-kk_combined}Limits on the mass of
      possible Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gluon in decays to
      $\ttbar$ pairs from a combination of results in
      Refs.~\cite{B2G-12-005,B2G-12-006}. }
\end{figure}


In both of the BSM solutions to the hierarchy problem outlined above
(SUSY and ED), the majority of the
lower masses for the new particles have been excluded. The top squark
mass is currently
constrained to be above $\sim$ 650 \GeVcc\ if the mass of the
neutralino is zero~\cite{SUS-13-011}, and the mass of
KK gluons is currently constrained to be
above $\sim$ 2.5 \TeVcc\ (Fig.~\ref{fig:limits-kk_combined}).
The Lorentz boosts of top quarks in the final state of these two cases
will be around $\gamma=4$ for the first case, and around $\gamma=7$ in
the second, which means the masses of the unexcluded particles will be
in the ``boosted regime'' in the upcoming 13 or 14 \TeV\ run of the
LHC (``Run 2'') and beyond (``Run 3''). Without using these
boosted-top strategies, the
sensitivity of searches for particles predicted by these BSM models is
reduced by a factor of ten or more, even at energies accessible during
Run 1 of the LHC. For instance, for a KK gluon with a mass of 2
\TeVcc, the sensitivity of boosted-top techniques is a factor of 10
better than the sensitivity without using these techniques. This
improvement grows even larger with the mass of the KK gluon. 

In Run 2 and beyond, using these boosted techniques will be even more
necessary to discover (or exclude) such particles that have
top quarks in the final states. For instance, the same KK gluon
model is expected to be excluded up to roughly 5 \TeVcc, where the top
quarks will have a Lorentz boost of $\sim\gamma=14$, in which the decay
products from the top quark will have $\Delta R < 0.14$
radians. Another example is top squark pair production, in
which case the kinematic limits are expected to be roughly $\sim$ 1
\TeVcc. In this case, the top quarks in the final state will have a
Lorentz boost of $\sim\gamma=6$, with the decay products falling
within $\Delta R < 0.35$. 






In summary, in order to explore the full phase space of interesting
solutions to the hierarchy problem, it will be critical to utilize
boosted-jet techniques. In particular, searches for $\ttbar$
resonances (such as the RS KK gluon) or sequential decays to the top
quark (such as the top squark) will not be successful unless
boosted-jet techniques are utilized. 



\section{CAREER Project Plan}

The searches outlined in this proposal use the boosted-jet
techniques developed during
Run 1 to search for
BSM physics in signatures containing one or more highly-boosted
top quarks that decay into all-hadronic final states
during Run 2 and Run 3 of the LHC. 

Despite an established physics program that Prof. Rappoccio has pioneered at CMS in
the area of boosted jets during Run 1, in order for the proposed
research program to be realized in Run 2 and beyond, major development
of the techniques must be done in order for them to continue functioning. 
These innovations must be reestablished in
an environment with an upgraded CMS detector, with an enormous
amount of instantaneous luminosity, resulting in many events
overlapping in the detector at once, or ``pileup''. For instance, in
Run 1 of the LHC, typically 20 pileup interactions occurred per beam
crossing. In Run 2, this will increase to 50. In Run 3,
the number of pileup events per beam crossing will be 140. The median
amount of energy that is produced from pileup in a solid angle
$d\Omega$ is approximately 0.8-1 \GeVc/radian$^2$/interaction. With 140
interactions, the amount of energy near a jet is approximately 100-140
\GeV, comparable to the interesting range of the underlying collision
already. 

Dealing with these two technical challenges will require the full
suite of
tools developed in the past to accomplish this daunting task, in new
and innovative ways. There are several challenges that must be met to
achieve this goal. The first is algorithmic development of the
boosted-jet algorithms 
themselves~\cite{Seymour:1993mx,boostedhiggs,catop_theory,catop_cms,jetpruning1,jetpruning2,trimming,nsub}. 
The second is the updating of the particle-flow algorithm
(PF)~\cite{particleflow}, upon which these boosted-jet techniques
heavily rely at CMS. 
The third is development and quality monitoring of reconstruction and
triggering strategies for boosted jets. 

These are now discussed in turn. 

\subsection{Boosted Jet Algorithms}

The performance of the boosted-jet algorithms at CMS will be heavily
affected by increasing pileup in Run 2 and beyond. For instance,
Fig.~\ref{jetmass_toptags_trimming} is a figure made by Dr. Dolen in
the context of the ``SnowMass on the Mississippi'' Community Summer
Study~\cite{snowmass}, and shows the jet
mass of a boosted top-quark jet in three separate cases during Run 3: 
without pileup (solid histogram), with 140 pileup
interactions (open green histogram), and with 140 pileup
interactions after applying an advanced boosted jet ``grooming''
technique (the ``jet trimming'' technique~\cite{trimming}, in the open
magenta
histogram). The naive implementation of the
``Run 1''-style
algorithm to a higher pileup regime fails miserably. The major
innovation of combining strengths from different techniques, however,
can rescue the performance quite handily, and restores the jet mass
almost back to the case where there was no pileup at all. 

This is one example of a problem that was already identified and fixed
by using innovative techniques to resolve the existing problems. There
are several other major limitations that are also under investigation
which will also require a heavy amount of development to solve for Run
2 and beyond. For example, boosted-jet techniques start to break down
at very high energies because the SM particles are sufficiently
boosted that their decay products fall into one single calorimeter
cell. This could be mitigated, for instance, with a more finely-tuned
PF algorithm as described in the next section. Only through a robust
and comprehensive development and deployment strategy will these
challenges be met. 

The work outlined in this proposal includes the development of new
techniques in order to fully realize the
capability of the CMS detector in discovering new physics with boosted
jets in an environment that is increasingly difficult to analyze. The
success of this approach
will require major innovations and cutting-edge tools, as
well as a broad view of the field at large. The
previous experience of Prof. Rappoccio (cited below) has provided the expertise
needed to solve these extensive problems, and can ensure that timely
and deployable strategies can be developed prior to the startup of Run
2 of the LHC.

      interactions (open green histogram), and with 140 pileup
      interactions after applying the jet trimming technique (open
      magenta histogram).}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Particle Flow}
\label{sec:pf}

The success of the general physics program at CMS during
the first run of the LHC, and in particular for the jet substructure
techniques outlined above, was heavily contingent on the
PF algorithm~\cite{particleflow}. 
When using the PF algorithm, performance of the top-tagging
algorithms at CMS was increased by 20\% compared to using calorimetric
information only, driven by the superior energy
and angular resolution of the algorithm. In addition, the PF algorithm
is capable of removing
over 60\% of pileup directly, by removing charged hadrons that are
associated to pileup vertices. This already reduces the scale of the
problem of pileup considerably, and the substructure algorithms at CMS
are heavily reliant on this technique. 

The PF algorithm, however, is heavily tuned (by construction) on the
Run 1 detector. A considerable amount of work must be done to migrate
the PF algorithm to the new detector conditions, as well as to adapt
to the enormous increase in pileup.
In the coming ``Phase 1'' and ``Phase 2''
tracker and HCAL upgrades at CMS~\cite{Dominguez:1481838,Mans:1481837}
the detector will be improved in a number of ways, including the
addition of a fourth silicon pixel layer to improve pileup
rejection, and
updates to the HCAL electronics to allow for readout of the
longitudinal segmentation of hadronic showers. These upgrades will
necessitate a second tuning of the PF
algorithm, with new opportunities and challenges directly
ahead. Mr. Kaisen and Prof. Rappoccio are already working with the
``global event description'' (GED), tracking and HCAL groups at CMS to
update the PF algorithm to take advantage of the new segmented HCAL
readout, as well as the new pixel-detector configurations. 

The success of the CMS boosted-object program is heavily
contingent on the success of the PF algorithm. Without the superior
energy and angular resolution of subjets and the pileup
reduction capabilities of the PF algorithm, the substructure
techniques we have developed will be significantly degraded.

However, with the newer detector comes new possibilities. It may be
possible to mitigate the efficiency loss of jet substructure
algorithms at very high energies (when $\gamma$ is so large that all of
the products decay in a single calorimeter cell) using the upgraded
detector capabilities. For instance, combining information from the
longitudinally-segmented
readout of the HCAL with the finer angular segmentation of the ECAL
and the trackers,
it may be possible to lessen the impact of the intrinsic
HCAL granularity. 
The upgraded CMS detector needs to be fully-utilized in order to
maximize the potential for physics discoveries. Advanced development
of the PF algorithm may illuminate new advantages that were
previously impossible.

\subsection{Trigger Development and Data Quality Monitoring}

In order to analyze highly-boosted topologies in BSM searches, 
the relevant data must be collected in efficient triggers. Furthermore, the
reconstruction, calibration, and trigger efficiencies of these
algorithms must be incorporated in the overall program of 
data-quality monitoring (DQM) at CMS. At the present time, there are
very few triggers that are capable of collecting boosted-jet
events in the upcoming Run 2, and those that do exist necessitate very
high kinematic thresholds which limit their sensitivity. This needs
immediate rectification if we are to be prepared to adequately perform
these searches for new physics with boosted objects detailed in this
proposal. 

A major difficulty here is that the jets in events in
Run 2 will be highly-polluted with pileup interactions. 
In fact, using algorithms that we have previously developed in Run 1
to deal with pileup mitigation may not continue to work in Runs 2 and
3 with
such large pileup. Since there is a large stochastic fluctuation of
the pileup background (roughly 1 \GeVc\ per jet), with 140 pileup
interactions, a 400 \GeVc\ jet will be expected to be composed of
nearly 50\% pileup. 

Rigorous and
expansive application of boosted-jet, jet-substructure, pileup
removal, and other advanced techniques
will be necessary to collect the boosted-jet datasets with reasonable
efficiency without having enormously high event rates. For instance,
if one were to select events with a jet-mass requirement, without any
corrections the trigger rate would grow linearly with the number of
pileup interactions, and without any corrections the trigger would
rapidly become untenable. However, from the studies by Prof. Rappoccio in
Ref.~\cite{SMP-12-019}, it is observed that applications of grooming
techniques to the jets can eliminate the growth of the jet mass with
increasing pileup entirely. Further investigations in this avenue of
inquiry are sure to yield extremely promising results. 


Dr. Dolen and Ms. Alyari will partake in the analysis and development
of the triggering program at CMS to ensure that boosted-jet searches
will acquire the necessary data in Run 2 without having event rates
that simply scale linearly with pileup. 
Furthermore, Ms. Alyari will be participating in the DQM of generic
and boosted jets to ensure that the algorithms are being implemented
effectively and that no adverse interactions occur unexpectedly,
thereby ensuring the safety of the physics program proposed here. 






\section{Prior Work with Boosted Objects}

\subsection{CMS Activities}

Prof. Rappoccio has played a critical leading role in implementing and
understanding these jet substructure and boosted techniques at the LHC
in general, and is the foremost expert of this topic at CMS.
His early studies (before collision data) and
implementation of the algorithms are outlined in
Ref.~\cite{catop_cms}. He has authored the first searches
for new physics with collision data to be published using boosted
top~\cite{EXO-11-006} and boosted $W/Z$~\cite{EXO-11-095} techniques
anywhere in the world, as well as the first measurement of the jet
mass at CMS~\cite{SMP-12-019}. In addition, he has contributed to
several of the now-seminal review papers about the subject, which are
used as standard references and benchmarks in the community at
large~\cite{boost2010,boost2011}. 

After these pioneering efforts successfully established the CMS
Collaboration as a world leader in the fields of jet substructure and
boosted hadronic final states, Prof. Rappoccio
was made the convener of the ``Beyond Two Generations'' Physics
Analysis Group (B2G PAG) at CMS, which focuses on these highly-boosted
final states, in particular in the top sector. 
In his tenure as convener since August 2012, CMS has deployed these
techniques in 5 analyses of the 8 \TeV\ data (in preparation for paper 
submission)~\cite{B2G-12-005,B2G-12-006,B2G-12-012,B2G-12-015,B2G-12-019}. 
Furthermore, the techniques are being adopted in four other
analyses to search for other exotic signatures (including the 8-\TeV\
continuation of Ref.~\cite{EXO-11-095} in Ref.~\cite{EXO-12-024}), as
well as two analyses to search for supersymmetry. 

%The performance we have achieved with these algorithms is nothing
%short of astonishing. First with 7 \TeV\ collision data, and now with
%8 \TeV\ collision data, the efficiency to identify fully-merged
%top-quark jets is approximately 50\% with a misidentification rate of
%approximately 5\%, and the efficiency to identify fully-merged
%$W/Z$-boson jets is approximately 70\% with a misidentification rate
%of approximately 20\%. 
The latest 8 \TeV\ limits using boosted
techniques to search for $\ttbar$ resonances are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:limits-kk_combined} and finally probe, for
the first time, a viable region of parameter space available for
models of ED that are not already disfavored by
precision measurements~\cite{Davoudiasl:2009cd}. 
Without the boosted-jet strategies for searches that Prof. Rappoccio has
developed, it would not have been possible to access this regime at
CMS by any other method. This highlights the absolutely critical
nature of developing these tools in searches. 



In addition to pioneering the searches for new physics using
boosted-jet techniques, Prof. Rappoccio has also been instrumental in developing,
commissioning, and maintaining the general jet reconstruction and
particle-flow algorithms at CMS. Some of the areas in which
He has played a leading role are the development of the ``charged
hadron subtraction'' algorithm at CMS, where charged PF candidates
associated with pileup vertices were removed directly from
jets, resulting in a 10-20\% improvement in the jet energy
resolution, as well as the development of the
median-$p_\mathrm{T}$-per-unit-area pileup correction for jets at CMS. He was also
instrumental in getting the ``anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$'' algorithm~\cite{ktalg} accepted
by the CMS collaboration, and redesigned the software framework to
make usage of the {\tt fastjet} package~\cite{fastjet,fastjet1} so as to have a
common algorithmic basis for jet reconstruction in ATLAS, CMS, and the
theoretical community. He also
participated in the software validation and
data-quality monitoring (DQM) of the jets at CMS before and during the
Run 1 startup commissioning at 2.36 and 7 \TeV. 


\subsection{Non-CMS Activities}
To highlight the importance of this project, the SnowMass effort
described above has made the identification of boosted jets an
extremely high priority for the future of HEP in general. Dr. Dolen
has been extensively involved in this effort, and is co-leading the
group that focuses on boosted top-quark tagging techniques. 

In addition, Prof. Rappoccio has played an integral part of the {\bf BOOST}
conference series and other conferences, such as the {\bf Boston Jet
  Substructure Workshop}. The BOOST conference is the foremost
conference on jet substructure and boosted-jet algorithms, and the
conference reports in 2010 and 2011 are used as standard references in
benchmarking these techniques~\cite{boost2010,boost2011}.

\section{Timeline}
\label{sec:timeline}

\begin{description}
\item[Phase I - LHC Shutdown and CMS Upgrade (2013-2014): ] At the
  completion of analysis of the 8 \TeV\ run of the
  LHC in 2012, we have performed searches using these techniques that
  have not discovered new physics. However, as described above, an
  enormous amount of development must be done to ensure that CMS is
  prepared for Run 2, and in particular to ensure that the boosted-top
  algorithms perform optimally. During the
  shutdown period between Runs 1 and 2, significant amounts of work
  will be done to develop the algorithms to their optimum capacity, to
  ensure that the particle-flow algorithm is performing correctly, and
  to mitigate pileup as much as possible. Dr. Dolen, Mr. Kaisen,
  and Ms. Alyari will continue their work on boosted-jet algorithms,
  particle-flow algorithm development, triggering development, and
  data-quality monitoring.

\item[Phase II - LHC Run 2 (2015?-2017?)] The increase of the center-of-mass
  energy from 8 \TeV\ to 13-14 \TeV\ will dramatically increase the
  reach of searches for new particles decaying to boosted top
  quarks. During the startup of the LHC, the particle flow and DQM
  projects outlined above will be in full operation and used for
  commissioning the new detector in new beam conditions. 
  As the data are collected at 13-14 \TeV, the searches proposed here
  will be at the very
  center of any discoveries involving top quarks. During this period,
  major publications will involve searches for $\ttbar$ resonances and
  $t+b$ resonances, as well as searches for supersymmetric top squarks. 

\item[Phase III - LHC Shutdown and CMS Upgrade (2017?-2019?)] The
  feasibility and timeline of the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is
  still very much in flux. There are, however, good
  theoretical reasons to expect that the hierarchy problem will be
  better understood by this period. 
  In any case, the techniques developed in the
  previous Phases of this proposal will be highly-applicable in an
  environment with enormous amounts of pileup. Should the solution to
  the hierarchy problem continue to elude us after Run 2, the
  techniques we develop will still allow for
  the further examination of the hierarchy problem with large amounts
  of integrated luminosity (at the cost of higher pileup). In
  order to maintain efficacy, continual improvements must be made to
  boosted-jet searches to ensure that the increased pileup will not
  pose a dramatic threat to the goals of the program. By using
  advanced techniques, the pileup problem can be significantly
  mitigated, as shown above. 


\end{description}

\section{Outreach and education}
\label{sec:outreach}


While it is critical to pursue a rigorous research program, a large
part of the responsibility of scientists is to educate the next
generation effectively. There is already extensive work being done to
educate high school-level students and teachers via the {\em QuarkNet}
program (in which UB participates in), however there is
very little in the way of educating younger people and the general
public. 
The plan outlined in this proposal will engage the broader
public in discussions of major results in particle
physics, as well as to enliven particle physics for young students. 
This will be implemented based on two programs: (a) public events such
as the ``HiggsFest''~\cite{higgsfest} that Prof. Rappoccio organized at UB,
and (b) to develop a Mobile Application which aims to educate
young people about particle physics in an entertaining way. 


\subsection{Higgsfest and other public events}

The ``Higgsfest'' that was organized here at UB in 2012
is highlighted in Ref.~\cite{higgsfest}. The aim of the event was to
invite the general public for ``plain English'' summaries and hands-on
demonstrations that were geared for a multitude of age and knowledge
levels. 
This was attended by over 100 people, including children,
high-school students, physics and non-physics undergraduates, and
interested members of the community. 

Some of the hands-on demonstrations included building models of
Feynman diagrams from craft material (for young children), a
fully-functional four-layer coincidental muon scintillator detector,
a cloud chamber made out of tupperware, felt, and dry ice, and the
actual Higgs events from the CMS collaboration in an interactive event
display. 
The event was covered by the ``UB Reporter'' here at
UB~\cite{higgsfest_ubreporter}. 

Two more such events are proposed, the first to coincide with the LHC
turn-on sometime in 2015, and the second to coincide with the newest
results from the LHC after data-taking commences. These are 
events that should generate high media coverage, and will be a good
opportunity to capitalize on public interest in this field. Having
regular events to discuss the LHC results is a very long-term goal,
and the opportunity to develop them with the CAREER proposal
will be very useful. In the event of a major new discovery at the LHC
during Run 2, the public interest will be very high, so having the
experience of what works and what does not work in such events is
extremely valuable to maximize the public impact. 

In addition, this removes the stigma associated with science and
technology fields at an early age. When young children can attend an
event with their parents and take something away from it, this shows
them that science is an integral part of life, and nothing to be
particularly nervous about pursuing. It may even convince younger
people to pursue a scientific career. 

One of the major points learned during the last ``Higgsfest''
is that it is often difficult to have economically-disadvantaged
students attend the lectures because of a lack of transportation
possibilities. This is something to rectify for future
projects along these lines. Therefore, in addition to holding the
event directly
at the UB North Campus (which is difficult for inner-city
Buffalo schools to reach), a duplicated event is also proposed
closer to the inner city that is easier to attend, or possibly to
visit these schools directly. Some possible
locations are the UB South Campus, or at
``Babeville''~\cite{babeville}, where the UB Physics
Department routinely organizes the ``Science and Art
Cabaret''~\cite{cabaret}. Both locations 
provide the infrastructure needed for the event, and
access for disadvantaged schools and students in the inner city of
Buffalo. 


%In addition, I have also participated in the Buffalo
%area's ``Science Cabaret''~\cite{cabaret} which intends to discuss
%science and art in a very informal and relaxed setting. 

\subsection{Mobile Application for particle physics outreach}

Although ``smart phones'' are nearly ubiquitous, precious few
quality mobile applications exist for physics education of elementary,
middle, and high school-age students that are free of charge, and few
applications exist for particle physics at all. Reaching this younger
generation of students means
that we, as educators, must be able to communicate with them on their
own level. A mobile application that is capable of capturing the
imaginations and interest of young people will be a valuable tool in
order to educate them about particle physics. This is similar to the
NSF-funded project ``Quarked!''~\cite{quarked},
also designed for younger-aged students. The current proposal will be
similar but complementary to this project, with the innovation here
being that the actual rules of the game that the students are playing
are the rules of particle physics, and hence they will be learning the
physics as they learn to play the game itself. This will even allow
the analysis of how much the players are learning by how well they do
in the games. 

In addition, this could be used in the extensive
``Physics and Arts Exhibition'' at the Physics Department at UB, or at
the ``Science and Art Cabaret''~\cite{cabaret}, also partially
organized by the Physics Department. 


The mobile application will be
downloaded by users free of charge, and will provide several choices
of games to play based on particle physics. 
For instance, one game will be a two-dimensional ``puzzle'' game
(similar to, for instance, ``Simple Physics''~\cite{simplephysics})
which will involve the player arranging Feynman diagrams with
multi-touch finger gestures.
Another will be a ``proton collision'' game where the players
``shoot'' protons at each other in a targeting game (similar to
``Angry Birds''~\cite{angrybirds}). 
The app will have educational lessons ``pop up'' to teach
the users about the fundamental physics involved in a simple way. For
instance, the Feynman diagrams could provide information about the
quarks, leptons, bosons, and particles beyond the SM, and the
accelerator game could show how electric
and magnetic fields are used in accelerators. 

\iffalse
For illustrative purposes,
Fig.~\ref{fig:storyboard_summary_quarkkids} shows a skeleton
``storyboard'' for one particular lesson that could be done, to teach
children about the quantum electrodynamics of electrons. 
The student
will be instructed about the possible ``diagrams'' (phrased in a way
that they can relate to), and asked to solve Feynman diagram
``puzzles'' based on the rules. The
student will then be presented with an incomplete diagram and some
possible options to complete it. They will then drag 
one of the possible pieces into the field of the
Feynman diagram to complete the puzzle, and their score can be based
on the number of completed diagrams. If the user needs a hint, it will
be available for a cost of ``points''. This could be linked into actual
event displays of LHC or LEP events so that the student could see them
directly in the data. 
\fi

In addition to educating students, this tool
could also be used
as an interactive part of the public outreach events described above,
giving the participants a concrete ``take-home message'', which can be
used by teachers to continue the educational components, etc, thereby
increasing the efficacy of both programs. 

\iffalse
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{storyboard_summary_quarkkids}
    \caption{\label{fig:storyboard_summary_quarkkids}Example
      ``storyboard'' for a mobile application aimed at teaching
      students particle physics. }
\end{figure}
\fi


The approach of using such video games for educational purposes is a
relatively new concept, with the aim of capturing
the imagination of students while instructing them. For instance, the
popular game ``SimCity''~\cite{simcity} has a new version released under GlassLab,
Inc. called ``SimCityEDU''~\cite{simcityedu}, as featured in 
{\bf USA Today}~\cite{simcityedu_usatoday}. Such developments have
prompted such philanthropic giants such as the ``Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation''~\cite{gates}
and the ``John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
Foundation''~\cite{macfound} to begin programs to educate young people
with video game and other online technologies, as well as
government-sponsored projects such as the NSF programs ``Computing
Education for the 21st Century'' (CE21) and ``Innovative Technology
Experiences for Students and Teachers'' (ITEST). Subsequent to
this grant, these are all viable avenues of long-term support for
this project.


Since this is such a new approach, it has not yet
obtained universal acceptance as an effective method of education. To
address this, the mobile
application will natively allow the gaming system to collect
information about how quickly students are learning concepts in the
educational components by evaluating how well they perform in the game
itself. This information can tell how many times students are
accessing information to learn about the topic, how many iterations it
takes for them to understand the concepts, etc. For instance, data
will be collected on the number of tries that
a user attempts to create a given Feynman diagram, or how often they
have to resort to hints to solve their puzzles. With an online
agreement (see below), Prof. Rappoccio could collect these data remotely and analyze
their efficacy. This information could also be used in publications or
in reports of the efficacy of video gaming technology in educational
systems, something that may be of interest to the aforementioned
foundations and other organizations, including the NSF. 

In order to collect this information, since the program is targeted
for younger audiences, it will be necessary to comply with the
``Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)''~\cite{coppa}. 
The proposed software will not collect any information related to
identification of the students or parents involved at all (as defined
by the terms of COPPA), and only the scores and the ages of the
students will be collected, upon consent of the parent before the
application is downloaded. There will be an End Users's License
Agreement which outlines what data are collected (scores and ages of
the students), and only upon permission. It will still be possible to
use the application if the parent chooses not to collect the scores,
upon which the collection of scores will be disabled. 

The general support to develop such a mobile application is, at this
stage, very advanced already. The software in this proposal will use
the ``Kivy''  {\tt python}-based
framework~\cite{kivy} to develop cross-platform two-dimensional games
that can be packaged and bundled for a multitude of environments,
including Windows, Mac OS X, Android, and iOS~\cite{kivy}. This
platform requires very little extensive knowledge in graphics design
or mobile application development, with open-source
community support and a plethora of examples. Prof. Rappoccio has
around 5 years of experience in {\tt python} programming, as well as 3
years of experience designing Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). It is very simple to create two-dimensional games
with this platform, and this is the preferred technology to
utilize. It will also encourage open-source modification so, if the
idea takes hold, people can create their own modifications to the game
itself with minimal programming experience and efforts. 


\subsection{Undergraduate research}

Having been an undergraduate researcher, Prof. Rappoccio knows the importance
of making a positive impression on undergraduates who are interested
in pursuing an academic career. 
He is currently advising two undergraduate students in his group,
Brendan Smith and Jonathan Goodrum. Mr. Goodrum is participating in the
``Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program'' (CSTEP) here at
UB. This program focuses on disadvantaged or minority
students who would otherwise have a difficult time pursuing
STEM-related fields. Prof. Rappoccio is a strong believer in the principles and
practice of this program, and intends to continue this work in the
future. Currently, Mr. Goodrum is participating in a study to increase
the processing speed of jet-clustering algorithms (critical for the
jet substructure outlined above) by investigating possible
parallelization of the algorithms for multicore, multithread, and
possibly graphical processing unit usage. 

In addition, Mr. Smith is obtaining a complete hands-on immersion at the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) during the summer of
2013. There, he is participating in testing of major electronics
modules for the forward pixel (FPIX) upgrade at CMS. This kind of
experience is invaluable in the field of young researchers, and it is also
planned to continue supporting undergraduate students in such hands-on
activities at CERN next year under the NSF Cooperative Agreement that is
under review at the present time, discussed in the ``Current and
Pending Support'' section below (Proposal Number 7334626). 

\section{Prior Work in Education and Outreach}

As Prof. Rappoccio wholeheartedly believes in the importance of outreach and
educational activity, he has extensively participated in outreach
activities throughout his career. Some examples are

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Facilitator, CMS Data Analysis School, Fermilab, Batavia IL
  (Jan 2013, Jan 2011)} : facilitated the education of new CMS members
through tutorials and hands-on exercises of real-life
measurements. 
\item {\bf ``Higgsfest'' public lecture, Buffalo NY (Dec 6 2012)}: as
  described above, the ``Higgsfest'' was a celebration of the
  discovery of the SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC focused on outreach
  to the community. 
\item {\bf Science Cabaret public lecture, Buffalo NY (Oct 17 2012)}:
  lecture about the statistics behind the discovery of the Higgs boson
  aimed at conveying the information to a group of members of the
  artistic and public communities in Buffalo. 
\item {\bf Fermilab UEC Trip to Washington, D.C. (Spring 2009, Spring
    2011)} : advocacy trip to visit members of Congress to
  spread information related to particle physics. 
\item {\bf Angels and Demons public lecture, Bethlehem Public Library,
    Delmar NY (May 15 2009)} : related to the release of the film
  ``Angels and Demons,'' a large-scale public lecture series was
  organized by the Fermilab outreach department, and Prof. Rappoccio gave the
  lecture at a library outside of Albany, NY. 
\item {\bf Chicago Section of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy,
    Elmhurst, IL (Jan 13 2009)} : lecture of the methodologies and
  results of collider physics to an engineering society in the Chicago
  Area. 
\item {\bf Lecture, Bethlehem Central High School,
    Delmar NY (Dec 4 2008)} : lecture to high-school students from the
  high school I graduated from about particle physics and the LHC. 
\item {\bf Duckon Science Fiction Convention, Naperville IL (Jun 14
    2008)} : lecture about the ``real'' science of the LHC compared to
  science fiction. 
\item {\bf Starter Kit for LHC Newcomers and Physics Analysis Toolkit
    Tutorials, Fermilab, Batavia IL, also CERN, Geneva CH (throughout
    2008-2009)} : as part of his duties for the LHC support team at
  Fermilab, Prof. Rappoccio developed an education program for students,
  postdoctoral fellows, and faculty that were new to the CMS
  experiment with hands-on examples, simple walk-through tutorials,
  and in-person support. This eventually developed into full-fledged
  activities at CERN for the tutorials, as well as was the precursor
  for the hugely successful ``CMS Data Analysis School,'' as much of
  the material was initially developed there. 
\item Prof. Rappoccio currently oversees the research and education of {\bf Joshua
    Kaisen} and {\bf Maral Alyari} as graduate students in his
  group. Mr. Kaisen is working on upgrading the particle-flow
  algorithm to work in the upgraded CMS detector. {\bf Ms. Alyari}
  will be working on data-quality monitoring of the particle-flow and
  jet-reconstruction algorithms.
\item Previously, at JHU, Prof. Rappoccio also oversaw the graduate studies of 
  {\bf Guofan Hu, Marc Osherson, Kevin Nash, and Yongjie Xin} who are
  working on searches for BSM physics using boosted jet
  algorithms. Dr. Hu graduated recently and moved to a position in
  finance, while Mr. Osherson, Mr. Nash, and Mr. Xin are continuing
  their studies, still partially under his supervision. 
\item Prior to the monitoring of the activities of {\bf Brendan Smith} and 
  {\bf Jonathan Goodrum}, at JHU Prof. Rappoccio monitored the activities of two
  undergraduate students, 
  {\bf David Bjergaard} and {\bf Prateek Bajaj}. Mr. Bjergaard is now
  at Duke University pursuing a Ph.D. in particle physics. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}

In summary, the program that has been proposed here is ambitious and
high-profile, but one in which Prof. Rappoccio has a unique talent set to
accomplish. This program will have an excellent chance of uncovering BSM
physics during Run 2 of the LHC and beyond. The previous experience of
Prof. Rappoccio with
boosted-jet techniques will be absolutely critical to ensure that the
techniques are as successful in Run 2 as they were in Run 1, amidst a
sea of technical challenges. 

In addition to this ground-breaking research, a broad
spectrum of outreach and educational activities is proposed. Foremost
amongst
these are events such as successors to ``Higgsfest'' in the Buffalo
area (including lower-income places that have limited access to
suburban venues), as well as the development of a Mobile Application
to instruct students about particle physics in an interactive way.

\noindent{\Large \bf BUDGET JUSTIFICATION}

\bigskip
{\bf Institution : } The State University of New York at Buffalo (UB)

{\bf PI : } Salvatore Rappoccio


\bigskip
{\bf Personnel}
\bigskip

Salvatore Rappoccio (tenure-track Assistant Professor) joined the
Faculty at the University at Buffalo, SUNY (UB) in 2012. The UB group
has an
NSF grant (Award Number 1205960, July 15th 2012 - June 30th 2015) from
Professors Kharchilava and Iashvili, however this
was renewed one year before Prof. Rappoccio joined the Faculty and does not
provide support for him or his group. 

Prof. Rappoccio's group is currently supported on his startup funds,
which will run out by 30-June-2014. If no funding is found, the
support for Dr. Dolen, Mr. Kaisen, and Ms. Alyari will run out, and
they will not be able to continue their studies. 


\bigskip


The requested funds of \$869,953 USD (for 5 years starting in 2014)
would cover two (2) months of summer salary for Prof. Rappoccio per
year for five (5) years
(\$82,686), the full salary for 
one (1) postdoctoral fellow, Dr. James Dolen (\$218,570) for five (5)
years, and salary plus
tuition for two (2) graduate students, one in-state (Joshua
Kaisen) and one out-of-state (Maral Alyari), totaling \$156,121 in
salary and \$21,281 in tuition. 
It is anticipated that Kaisen and
Alyari will graduate around the end of this proposal.


\bigskip
{\bf Travel}
\bigskip

This research will require significant travel to CERN to participate
in CMS meetings for Prof. Rappoccio. Additionally, this will cover
travel costs for Dr. Dolen, Mr. Kaisen and Ms. Alyari for relocation
to Fermilab or CERN. 
Hence, the proposal requests \$32,498 in travel funds for the five
years of activity. 

\bigskip
{\bf Facilities and Administration Indirect Costs}
\bigskip

The above figures carry an indirect cost
percentage of 26\% for Dr. Dolen, Mr. Kaisen and Ms. Alyari as they
will not be located at the UB campus. The indirect cost
for Rappoccio's summer salary is 56\%, because he is located at the
UB Campus. The total indirect cost is \$224,648.

Below is a year-by-year summary of the funding request. 

\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf \Large Year One (1-June-2014 -- 31-May-2015)}
\bigskip

In the first year, Dr. Dolen will perform studies of the
boosted-top analyses at CMS to ensure that they will be
deployable in a very early timescale in Run 2. 

Mr. Kaisen will continue his work on adapting the particle-flow
algorithm to work in the upgraded detector geometries in the Phase 1
and Phase 2 upgrades of CMS. He is expected to finish his classes in
the Spring Semester, 2014, and will move to Fermilab for 1-2 years,
after which time he will move to CERN. 

Ms. Alyari will primarily focus on data-quality monitoring of the jet
reconstruction and jet substructure algorithms. She is expected to
finish her classes in the Fall Semester, 2013, and will move to
Fermilab for 1-2 years. She is expected to stay at Fermilab for the
remainder of her graduate studies. 

It is also expected that the baseline infrastructure for the Mobile
Application described above will be developed. 


\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf \Large Year Two (1-June-2015 -- 31-May-2016)}
\bigskip


In year two of this proposal, it is expected that the current
detectors will be reinserted and incorporated in global commissioning
runs collecting cosmic-ray data, followed by collision data later in the
year for the start of Run 2. The cosmic data can be used to investigate the
particle-flow algorithm reconstruction by Mr. Kaisen, as well as to
begin deployment of the DQM program by Ms. Alyari. The early collision
data will provide the necessary information for any further
tuning. Since this is a period of high activity, it
will be necessary to have a high presence of the group at CERN, and
as such, it is expected that Dr. Dolen and
Mr. Kaisen will have relocated there to partake in commissioning
activities. 
Ms. Alyari will be located at FNAL during this period. At FNAL, it is
expected that she will contribute heavily via the {\em Remote
  Operations Center} (ROC) at FNAL in the jet DQM.

The direction of the boosted algorithm studies should be guided by the
ground work done by Dr. Dolen and Prof. Rappoccio in year one of the proposal. 
The focus of year two should be guided by a timely deployment of these
solutions into the CMS reconstruction and DQM to ensure that
detailed simulation productions at CMS will include them for
widespread use, as well as a first look at the collision data during
Run 2. The vastly increased parton
luminosity at high-$x$ will mean that striking BSM signatures could be
seen very early. 

Since this is the year that the LHC startup will occur, 
the first public outreach event will be presented. A working version
of the Mobile Application is expected to be functional at the same
time to deploy during the event. 

\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf \Large Year Three (1-June-2016 -- 31-May-2017)}
\bigskip


It is expected that the Run 2 LHC will be fully
operational in year three of this proposal, and readily collecting
collision data for physics analysis. 

As the data are collected, it will be absolutely imperative to have
the boosted-jet algorithms deployed and characterized as well as
possible to be able to perform BSM searches immediately to see any new
discoveries as quickly as possible. The particle flow algorithm should
be fully commissioned, and the jet DQM will be in a ``production''
mode. 

It is also expected that between years three and four, Run 2
will end, and part of the Phase 1 upgrades of the CMS detector will be
implemented. This will require further tuning and monitoring of the PF
algorithm and the jet reconstruction software to handle the newest
detector, and to be ready for startup again for Run 3. The work of
Mr. Kaisen and Ms. Alyari will be imperative to the successful usage
of the Phase-1 upgraded detector in collisions. 

\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf \Large Year Four (1-June-2017 -- 31-May-2018)}
\bigskip

In year four of this proposal, it is expected that the full Run 2
dataset will be finalized, and the second long shutdown (``LS2'') of
the LHC will be ongoing. The BSM analyses of boosted
jets should be close to finalized at that point, with preliminary results
and possibly a publication, on the discovery of new physics (if
found), or on severe limits of possible BSM scenarios. 

The rest of the CMS Phase 1 upgrades will also be completed during
this time. Another tuning of the PF algorithm will be necessary to
cope with the changing detector conditions. 

It is expected that Dr. Dolen will play a leading role in the
experiment during this time. He should also be investigating the
possibility of faculty positions to further his academic career. 

Mr. Kaisen and Ms. Alyari will be expected to continue their
supporting work of the PF algorithm and DQM, respectively, although
their activities should be winding down at that point. They will
focus on their respective thesis topics and prepare for graduation as
well. At this time, it will be natural for newer students to share
some of the time commitment for the development of the PF algorithm
and the DQM, to be ready to transition once Mr. Kaisen and Ms. Alyari
graduate. 



\bigskip
\bigskip
{\bf \Large Year Five (1-June-2018 -- 31-May-2019)}
\bigskip


During year five of this proposal, it is expected that some or all of
the personnel will be transitioning to the next stages in their
careers. The full Run 2 dataset should be mostly in hand, and the
question of the hierarchy problem will finally be
illuminated, either by a discovery or stringent limits on BSM
physics involving boosted top quarks. 

It is important to maintain a flexible work plan during this 
phase to deal with unforeseen circumstances, but Dr. Dolen,
Mr. Kaisen, and Ms. Alyari will continue the work much as in year
four, while taking the necessary time to interview and search for the
next opportunities for their career. Younger students will be
starting around this time also, to take over work in the PF
reconstruction and the DQM. 


At the end of Year Five and beyond, Run 3 of the LHC will be on the
immediate horizon, and the fruits of the labors of the fully upgraded
CMS will finally be all in hand. The PF algorithm and boosted
techniques should be well-developed, and available as a long-term
legacy of the research plan from this proposal. The direction of the
research plan of Rappoccio's group will very much depend on what is
(or is not) seen during Run 2, but the fundamental developments will
be widely applicable during Run 3, and at that point will be robust
and well-understood techniques, widely deployed throughout the
collaboration. The impact of this proposal will be very large, and
will be able to impact the physics of the LHC program far into the
future.

\noindent{\Large \bf Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources}

\bigskip
{\bf Laboratory Space}

The UB group has two 900 sqft labs, VME/NIM crates,
several PC's, a Tektronix Logic Analyzer, several scintillator-based
muon detectors with photo-multiplier tubes, and a machine shop. 
In addition, the UB group has extensive access to the Silicon
Detector Laboratory Facility (``SiDet'') at FNAL. 

\bigskip
{\bf Center For Computational Research}

UB has a large computational research center, CCR, which is a
Linux-based cluster on the Open Science Grid, and also has a large GPU
cluster for possible parallel processing developments. 

\bigskip
{\bf Office}

The faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students all have
office space at FNAL and at CERN. In addition, when at UB,
there is a large working area inside of the lab of Profs. Kharchilava
and Iashvili. 


\newpage
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\renewcommand{\thepage} {D--\arabic{page}}
\noindent{\Large \bf Postdoctoral Fellow Mentoring}

One postdoctoral fellow will be funded on this project. There are
extensive postdoctoral fellowship mentoring activities at UB, at the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), and via the CMS
Experiment at CERN. These include guidance in career paths,
work/life balance discussions, and technical skill development such as
writing grant proposals, etc. Specific elements are highlighted
below. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf University at Buffalo (UB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The UB Office of Postdoctoral Scholars offers diverse services
  for postdoctoral fellows, including the {\sl ``Postdoc Survival
    Skills Workshops''}, targeted seminars and symposia for
  postdoctoral fellows, social functions, and logistical assistance. 
\item The UB Physics Department offers several services to our
  postdoctoral fellows, including a biweekly Journal Club for particle
  physics and cosmology, weekly seminars and colloquia, and weekly
  social functions inside the department. 
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The postdoctoral mentoring programs at FNAL are well-developed
  and tailored specifically for US-based researchers in particle
  physics. This includes the ``LHC Physics Center'' (LPC) at FNAL,
  which is a ``brick-and-mortar'' place for LHC researchers to be
  productive in a place other than CERN, as well as to provide
  much-needed visibility for postdoctoral fellows in a large
  collaboration. 
\item FNAL provides a continuous stream of colloquia, seminars,
  workshops and conferences throughout the year where postdoctoral
  fellows can meet others in their field, expand their learning
  opportunities, and provide a forum for them to present their work on
  a regular basis. 
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf CMS Experiment and CERN}
\begin{itemize}
\item As at FNAL, the opportunities for a postdoctoral fellow at CERN
  and at CMS are extensive. There are also a plethora of workshops,
  seminars, conferences, etc, at CERN. There are also smaller weekly
  avenues for networking possibilities, as well as seminars for
  postdoctoral fellows to gain visibility for their work. 
\item It is also worth pointing out that, because of the world-class
  nature of CERN, it often attracts very high-level members of the
  particle physics community on a regular basis. Such opportunities
  for visibility among the top-tier scientists in the world (including
  Nobel and Milner Prize winners, etc) are hard to understate. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In all, the postdoctoral fellow that will be supported by this
proposal will have ample opportunities for professional advancement
and development, as well as a myriad of opportunities for a community
of peers in both professional and social settings.

\noindent{\Large \bf Data Management Plan : Research Data}

The CMS experiment is dedicated to timely dissemination of its data and
procedures, in addition to documentation of results in publications
and journal articles. The LHC experiments (including CMS) are world
leaders in grid computing and cloud-like data storage, and the
solutions that have been developed have robustly handled the many
petabytes of data that have been collected. There are several
``tiers'' of data, which are designated by how widely they are
deployed throughout the Open Science Grid (OSG) and the other LHC
sites. 
The data ``tiers'' are :

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf RAW} : The raw data, collected in terms of simple detector
  readouts and event information. While rarely used for analysis, this
  is always available for all of the collected data at CMS
  indefinitely. 
\item {\bf Reconstruction (RECO)} : The reconstructed data, which
  utilizes the RAW data tier and computes relevant information in
  higher-level objects to be used by analyzers. 
\item {\bf Analysis Object Data (AOD)} : In Run 1, the RECO tier was
  too large to transmit throughout the OSG. Instead, a subset of the
  RECO was stored, the AOD tier. This was the primary tier for
  analysis usage, although it was more transient in nature. In Run 2,
  the computing model for this stage is still under development,
  although the functionality of the AOD tier will always be present.
\end{itemize}

These are stored at the various OSG sites of CMS as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Tier 0} : The long-term data collection and storage
  facilities are located at CERN, where the experiments are, including
  CMS. Data are collected and stored in RAW format at the Tier 0 site. 
\item {\bf Tier 1} : Subsequent to data-collection at the Tier-0
  facility, the data are shipped in RAW format to several sites
  worldwide (including to FNAL in the US) at facilities where the
  reconstruction software is run. Data are processed and stored in the
  RECO format at the Tier-1 sites. 
\item {\bf Tier 2} : For simulation of data, and for analysis, many
  smaller clusters are utilized throughout the world. These are
  typically stored locally in the AOD format. Since the simulated data
  are not stored locally at the Tier 0 site, there is one
  ``custodial'' Tier 2 which stores each generated sample centrally
  for the long term. 
\end{itemize}

In addition to these ``tiers'' of the actual data collected, there are
also software and documentation schema for the LHC data and analysis. 
The software for the reconstruction is stored and versioned locally at
CERN and duplicated at FNAL, and is visible to the
public~\footnote{https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/lxr/}. This has also now
been fully migrated to {\tt github}~\footnote{https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw}.  
While the data collected are initially
private to CMS, there are now mechanisms in place to make the entirety
of the data completely public, although this may take several years to
fully realize and deploy. In the meantime, there are well-defined
approval procedures to ensure that the data collected by CMS are made
public via documentation in webpages and journal publications, or by
data-sharing projects such as 
{\tt HEPDATA}~\footnote{http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk}. 


\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Data Management Plan : Mobile Application Data}
\bigskip

The data and meta-data collected from the Mobile Application will be
stored for each individual exercise, along with the age of the
student. As mentioned above, this will be done in a way that complies
with the ``Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
(COPPA)''~\cite{coppa}, as no personal information about the student
(or their parents) will be collected. The types of information that
will be stored are the number of attempts for each puzzle, the number
of hints used in each puzzle, the time it takes to complete each
puzzle, etc. This will be stored in {\tt sqlite} databases, interfaced
to {\tt python} to take advantage of the {\tt Kivy} framework tools
that will be used in the Mobile Application.
